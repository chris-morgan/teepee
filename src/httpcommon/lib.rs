//! Common HTTP functionality for the Teepee project.
//!
//! Anything shared between both client and server belongs in here, but this crate is not expected
//! to be used directly.
//!
//! Any crate using types from this crate should re‐export them. For example, the ``status`` module
//! should be exported in the root of the HTTP client crate ``httpc`` so that people can write
//! ``httpc::status`` instead of ``httpcommon::status``.
